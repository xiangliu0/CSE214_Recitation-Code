# Description
These are the code I wrote for [CSE 214: Data Structures & Algorithms](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/students/undergraduate-studies/courses/cse214) as an undergraduate TA in Fall 2024. Questions covered from Arrays, Linked List, Recursion, Trees, Stacks/Queues & Graphs. 

These code either came from questions that I wrote for homework/recitation/exams, or solutions to practice problems taught in recitation. 

As an undergrad TA, I wrote 15 questions per week and taught 2 60min recitation classes per week.
